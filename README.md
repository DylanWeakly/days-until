#### This web app allows you to input a date and have it tell you how many days remain until the target date. This is useful if a special event arises and you are eagerly awaiting it.
The app gathers the current date through a JavaScript Date object, which uses your local computer's time zone, enabling the app to be globally compatible.

## Instructions:
1. Clone the repo to your local machine using the Git CLI or GitHub Desktop.
2. Using VSCode, open the HTML file (`index.html`) with Live Server by right-clicking on the file and selecting 'Open with Live Server'.
3. The app should open in your web browser.
4. Input a date and click `Calculate` to see how many days away your special event is!
